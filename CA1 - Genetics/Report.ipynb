    "1. *The problems caused by an extremely large or small population size:*  \n",

    "    - as mention in question 1 increase population size in each generation helps us because we have more diversity but it also consume more time and memory in each generation that is not good.\n",
    "    - another bad point is we try to remove bad chromosome over generation and trying to converge our population to optimal answer but growing population in each generation harm the convergence.\n",

    "- CrossOver :\n",
    "    - Crossover is the process of combining genetic information from two parent chromosome to make better chromosomes\n",
    "    - Crossover helps maintain diversity and it allows the algorithm to converge faster toward promising solutions by exploiting the information shared among the population.\n",
    "- Mutation :\n",
    "    - Mutation is the process of changing gene(s) of one chromosome to make a better one.\n",
    "    - Mutation prevents premature convergence by ensuring that the search does not get stuck in local optima.\n",
    "- While it is theoretically possible to use only one of these operators, doing so may have significant drawbacks:\n",
    "   - 1.Using Only Crossover:  \n",
    "   The GA may suffer from a lack of genetic diversity, leading to premature convergence to suboptimal solutions and get stuck in local optima\n",
    "    - 2.Using Only Mutation:\n",
    "     It may take a longer time to reach good solutions and maybe cause algorithm has less diversity.\n",
    "4. *Approaches to solving the curve fitting problem faster:* \n",
    "    The parameters in problem are so effetive in solving speed.we can easily play with the and reach best values to solving problem faster.(change parameters in Const class) \n",
    "  \n",
    "5. *Solutions to stagnated chromosomes and getting stuck:*  \n",
    "    mutation is the solution for this problem as I mentioned in question 3 mutation helps us to escape local optima but if despite mutation still getting stuck , we can use `Multi-starting` means re-running algorithm with different initial population\n",

    "7. *As the polynomial degree increases, how does the time to find the coefficients change?* \n",
    "   When degree increases,out state space for chromosomes increase increases exponentially.Suppose that we don't have limit for number of generation,in worst case we have to traverse the entire state space to reach the answer so time to find the coefficients increases exponentially.\n",

    "    it depends on degree of equation :\n",
    "    - If number of points is less than the limit to represent a single polynomial, then the smaller the number of points, the sooner the algorithm will reach the solution.because more polynomials include those points.\n",
